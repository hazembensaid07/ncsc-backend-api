I am proud to announce that the registration website for NCSC is finally functional and successfully deployed 3 days ago to a sold-out congress.

Taking this stand first to thank Securinets and Yassine Belkhadem ( frontend developer) and the whole team of NCSC that trusted with this responsibility to develop a website for the first time in the NCSC history at its third edition. Hard work was certainly key and the amount of work I had to put on this project was enormous but I cannot emphasize enough the amount of support and encouragement that I have received from the whole team.
Thank you to the participants who trusted us with their time and money and hopefully this edition will be on fire compared to previous ones.
I am waiting impatiently for how successful NCSC 3.0 will be and always looking forward to better opportunities.
